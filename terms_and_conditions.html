    	<h3>Terms of Service</h3>
        <p> Urban Engines ("<span>Company</span>"), runs and operates location-based mobile apps and websites at <a href="#">www.urban-engines.com</a> and <a href="#">www.mapqam.com</a> (collectively the "<span>Apps</span>"). 
The apps allows you to use your mobile device's location services to help
you navigate through the world. 
Please read these Terms of Service (the "<span>Terms</span>") carefully because they govern your use of our Apps. </p>
        <h3>Agreement to Terms</h3>
        <p>By using either of the Apps, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you don't agree to these Terms, do not use the Apps. If you are accessing and using either of the Apps on behalf of a company (such as your employer) or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to these Terms. In that case, "you" and "your" will refer to that company or other legal entity. </p>
        <h3> Changes to Terms or Apps </h3>
        <p> We may modify these Terms at any time, in our sole discretion. If we do so, we'll let you know either by posting the modified Terms on the Site or through other communications. It's important that you review the modified Terms because if you continue to use the Apps after we've let you know that the Terms have been modified, you are indicating to us that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms. If you don't agree to be bound by the modified Terms then you may no longer use the Apps. Because our Apps are evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Apps, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.</p>
        <h3> Who May Use the Apps</h3>
        <h4>Eligibility</h4>
        <p> You may use the Apps only if you are 13 years or older and are not barred from using the Apps under applicable law. </p>
        <h4>Registration and Your Information</h4>
        <p>If you want to use certain features of the Apps you'll have to create an account ("<span>Account</span>"). You can do this via the Apps or through your account with certain third-party social networking services such as Facebook (each, an "<span>SNS Account</span>"). If you choose the SNS Account option we'll create your Account by extracting from your SNS Account certain personal information such as your name and email address and other personal information that your privacy settings on the SNS Account permit us to access. </p>
        <p>It's important that you provide us with accurate, complete and up-to-date information for your Account and you agree to update such information to keep it accurate, complete and up-to-date. If you don't, we might have to suspend or terminate your Account. You agree that you won't disclose your Account password to anyone and you'll notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your Account. You're responsible for all activities that occur under your Account, whether or not you know about them. </p>
        <h3> Feedback </h3>
        <p>We welcome feedback, comments and suggestions for improvements to the Apps ("<span>Feedback</span>"). You can submit Feedback from within the Apps or by emailing us at support@1618labs.com. If you provide us any Feedback, you agree that we may use, copy, modify, create derivative works of and otherwise exploit the Feedback for any purpose. </p>
        <h3> Content and Content Rights </h3>
        <p>For purposes of these Terms: (i) "<span>Content</span>" means works of authorship of any kind, including text, graphics, images, music, software, audio, video, and information or other materials that are posted, generated, provided or otherwise made available through the Apps; and (ii) "<span>User Content</span>" means any Content that Account holders (including you) provide to be made available through the Apps. Content includes without limitation User Content. </p>
        <h3> Content Ownership, Responsibility and Removal </h3>
        <p> Company does not claim any ownership rights in your User Content that you make available through the Apps and nothing in these Terms will be deemed to restrict any rights that you may have to use and exploit your User Content.

You acknowledge that the Apps and Content are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of the United States and foreign countries. You agree not to remove, alter or obscure any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Apps or Content. </p>

        <p>You are solely responsible for all your User Content. You represent and warrant that you own all your User Content or you have all rights that are necessary to grant us the license rights in your User Content under these Terms.

        <p> You can remove your User Content by specifically deleting it. However, in certain instances some of your User Content (such as posts or comments you make) may not be completely removed and copies of your User Content may continue to exist on Apps. We're not responsible or liable for the removal or deletion of (or the failure to remove or delete) any of your User Content. </p>

        <h3> Dispute Resolution </h3>
        <h4> Governing Law </h4>
        <p> These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. </p>
        <h4>Agreement to Arbitrate</h4>
        <p>You and Company agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Apps or Content (collectively, "Disputes") will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (the action described in the foregoing clause (ii), an " IP Protection Action"). The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action will be the state and federal courts located in the Northern District of California and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. You acknowledge and agree that you and Company are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and Company otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this "Dispute Resolution" section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this "Dispute Resolution" section will survive any termination of these Terms. </p>
        <h4>Arbitration Rules</h4>
        <p>The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("<span>AAA</span>") in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the "<span>AAA Rules</span>") then in effect, except as modified by this "Dispute Resolution" section. (The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/arb_med or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section. </p>
        <h4> Arbitration Process </h4>
        <p>A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175 and a separate form for California residents at <a href="#">http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015822.)</a> The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA's roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules. </p>
        <h4> Arbitration Location and Procedure </h4>
        <p>Unless you and Company otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and Company submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration. </p>
        <h4> Arbitrator's Decision </h4>
        <p>The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator's award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the "Limitation of Liability" section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant's individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Company will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys' fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration. </p>
        <h4>Fees</h4>
        <p> Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Company will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). </p>
        <h4> Changes </h4>
        <p> Notwithstanding the provisions of the "Changes to Terms or Apps" section above, if Company changes this "Dispute Resolution" section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to support@1618labs.com) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the "Last Updated" date above or in the date of Company's email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Company in accordance with the provisions of this "Dispute Resolution" section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms). </p>
        <h3> General Terms </h3>
        <p>These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Company and you regarding the Apps and Content, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Company and you regarding the Apps and Content. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. </p>
        <p>You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Company's prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null and of no effect. Company may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns. </p>
        <p>Any notices or other communications provided by Company under these Terms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given by Company: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the Site. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted. </p>
        <h5> Company's failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Company. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise. </h5>
