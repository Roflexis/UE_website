    	<h3>Privacy  Policy Statement</h3>
        <p>Urban Engines ("Urban Engines," "Company", "we", "us" or "our") 
provides this Privacy Policy to explain our practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information that we receive when you use our Services accessible through our mobile applications and website (collectively the "Services"). This Privacy Policy applies only to our Services and doesn't apply to any third-party websites, services or applications, even if they are accessible through our Services. </p>
        <p>By using our Services you understand and agree that we are providing a application for you to post content, including location information, photos, comments and other materials ("User Content"), to the Services.
        <p>By using our Services you understand and agree that we are providing
an application that needs location services from your phone, and to post content, including comments, photos and other materials ("User Content"), to the Services. </p>
       <h4>Information we collect directly</h4>
       <p>When you create an account we'll collect certain personal information such as your full name, email address and password â€“ Personally Identifiable Informa     tion (PII). </p>
       <h4>Location Information .</h4>
       <p> When you use our mobile applications we collect and store information about where you are located, such as by converting your IP address into a rough geolocation and accessing your mobile device's GPS coordinates if you enable location services on your device. We may use location information to improve and personalize our Services for you. </p>
       <h4>Device identifiers.</h4>
       <p> When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by apps. </p>
       <h4>How do we use your information? </h4>
       <p> User Content (e.g., comments, photos, and other materials ("Markers") that you post to the Services. </p>
       <p> If you choose to create an account through one of your accounts with certain third-party social networking services such as Facebook or Twitter (each, an "SNS Account"), you may have to provide us with your username (or userID) so that your identity can be authenticated by the SNS Account. When the authentication is complete, we'll be able to link your account with the SNS Account and access certain PII, such as your name and email address, and other PII that your privacy settings on the SNS Account permit us to access. We don't receive or store passwords for any of your SNS Accounts. </p>
       <h4>Information Collected Using Cookies .</h4>
       <p>We collect certain information through the use of "cookies," which are small text files that are saved by your browser when you access our Services. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to identify that you've logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with them. We may also use cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services and to customize and improve them. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted when you log off from the website and close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting cookies. Please note, however, that if you don't accept cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services. Some third-party services providers that we engage (including third-party advertisers) may also place their own cookies on your browser. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of cookies and does not include use of cookies by such third parties.</p>
       <h4>Information Related to Use of the Services .</h4>
       <p>Our servers automatically record certain information about how a person uses our Services (we refer to this information as "Log Data"), including both account holders and non-account holders (either, a "User"). Log Data may include information such as a User's Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, the web page that a User was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on our Services that a User clicked on and other statistics. We use this information to administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) this information to improve and enhance the Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our Users' needs and preferences. We also use the IP Address to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how our Services are used. </p>
       <p>Our main goal is to make our apps work beautifully and efficiently for you and all other users. We may use your information to help you efficiently access and use our Services and to provide and develop new products and features. In the future we may also include personalized content such as ads and marketing. </p>
       <h4>How we share your information. </h4>
       <p> We will not share any PII or User Content that we have collected from you except as described below: </p>
       <h4>Public markers.</h4>
       <p>Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as User Content, becomes available to the public. Once you have shared User Content or made it public, that User Content may be re-shared by others. If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service. </p>
       <h4>Information Shared with Our Services Providers . </h4>
       <p>We may engage third party service providers to work with us to administer and provide the Services. These third-party services providers have access to your PII and User Content only for the purpose of performing services on our behalf. </p>
       <h4>Information Shared with Third Parties .</h4>
       <p> We may use anonymized, aggregated, non-personally identifiable information that we collect through our users' use of the Services to maintain and improve our Services as well as build new services and applications. We may share aggregated information with third parties for industry analysis. </p>
       <h4>Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions .</h4>
       <p> Information that we collect from our users is considered to be a business asset. As a result, if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy or if we are acquired as a result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition or asset sale, your PII and User Content may be disclosed or transferred to the third-party acquirer in connection with the transaction. </p>
       <h4>Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others .</h4>
       <p> It is our policy to protect you from having your privacy violated through abuse of the legal systems, whether by individuals, entities or government, and to contest claims that we believe to be invalid under applicable law. However, it is also our policy to cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties. Accordingly, we reserve the right to disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary: (i) to satisfy or comply with any applicable law, regulation or legal process or to respond to lawful requests, including subpoenas, warrants or court orders; (ii) to protect our property, rights and safety and the rights, property and safety of third parties or the public in general; and (iii) to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal or unethical. </p>
       <h4>Information We Disclose With Your Consent or at Your Request .</h4>
       <p> We will share your PII and User Content with third-party sites or platforms, such as social networking sites, if you have expressly requested that we do so. </p>
       <h4>The Security of Your Information </h4>
       <p> We take reasonable measures to protect the information that we collect from or about you (including your PII) from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. We provide physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information we process and maintain. For example, we limit access to this information to authorized employees and contractors who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our mobile applications. Please be aware, however, that no method of transmitting information over the Internet or storing information is completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information. </p>
       <h4>Links to Other Sites </h4>
       <p>Our Services may contain links to other websites and services. Any information that you provide on or to a third-party website or service is provided directly to the owner of the website or service and is subject to that party's privacy policy. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to such websites or services and we're not responsible for the content, privacy or security practices and policies of those websites or services. To protect your information we recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of other websites and services that you access. </p>
       <h4> Modifying Your Information </h4>
       <p> We will retain your data and User Content for as long as you use the Services. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems as required by law. </p>
       <p>You can stop all collection of information by the mobile applications easily by uninstalling them, deleting your accounts on our website and not accessing them. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network. You can also request to opt-out via email, at support@1618labs.com </p>
       <h4> International Transfer </h4>
       <p>Information collected may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you're located outside the United States and choose to provide your information to us, we may transfer your information to the United States and process it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of any information represents your agreement to that transfer. </p>
       <h4>Our Policy Toward Children </h4>
       <p>Our Services are not directed to children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect PII and User Content from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected PII and User Content of a child under 13 we will take steps to delete such information from our files as soon as possible. </p>
       <h4>Changes to Privacy Policy </h4>
       <p>Any information that we collect is subject to the privacy policy in effect at the time such information is collected. We may, however, modify and revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we'll notify you of such changes by posting them on the Services or by sending you an email or other notification, and we'll indicate when such changes will become effective. </p>
